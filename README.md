## FTPython

FTPython is a command line interface FTP client written in Python using the socket module

### Why does this project exist?
I made this project for a few reasons:
1. I want to easily upload the ROMs I rip to my 3DS without having to take out the SD card
2. I don't trust other FTP clients because they're either proprietary or bundled with PUPs and malware
3. I wanted to learn more about networking and sockets

### Where is this project going?
As of writing this, all it can do is connect to an FTP server. No user input or anything.
Eventually I would like to have a fully functioning FTP client, so we'll see what I end up doing with this.
